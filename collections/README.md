# Collections in Java

Collections in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects. It's powerful, high-performance and flexible compared to arrays.

## Wrapper Classes and Collections

Collections can only store **objects**, not primitive types. To store primitive types, we need to use **wrapper classes**:
Wrapper class for a primitive type is the type capitalized, e.g., `Integer` for `int`.


- **Autoboxing:** 
Automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class (e.g., `int` to `Integer`).

- **Unboxing:** 
Automatic conversion of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type (e.g., `Integer` to `int`).
