# Math Random Method

`Math.random()` function returns the a random number number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).  
meaning the interval is : [0.0 - 1.0)

### More control
For more control over the range.
- For a range from 0 to n: we multiplie by (n+1) because the upper bound of the interval is not included, and return it as int or just round it.
