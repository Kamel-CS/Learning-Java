# Encapsulation in Java
Encapsulation involves bundling the data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
  - **Purpose:** Protects the integrity of the data.

## How Encapsulation Is Achieved
1. **Private Fields**
  To ensure restricted access outside of the class.

2. **Controlled Access Through Methods:**
  - `getter` methods allow access to private fields without exposing them directly.
  - `setter` methods allow to update the fields safely.
